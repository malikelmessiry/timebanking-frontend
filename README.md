# Community TimeBanking - Front-End

Frontend for our group project built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**.

## 🌐 Overview

This app is the client-side of our service marketplace platform, allowing users to:
- Browse and book services
- View and edit profiles
- Send messages
- Leave reviews (optional) **

It connects to a Django backend via REST API.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React** + **TypeScript**
- **Vite** (frontend build tool)
- **Axios** for HTTP requests
- **React Router** for navigation
- **Cloudinary** for image uploads
- **Jest/React Testing Library** for UI tests
